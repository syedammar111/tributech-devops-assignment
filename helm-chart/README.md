# DevOps Engineer Technical Assignment: Helm Chart with Keycloak, PostgreSQL, PGAdmin, and Website Deployment

## Objective

This assignment is designed to evaluate your ability to:
1. Design and write a Helm chart for a multi-component system.
2. Set up a local Kubernetes environment for testing and deployment.
3. Document your process, decisions, and provide clear instructions for testing.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Write a Helm Chart

Create an Umbrella Helm chart to deploy the following components in a Kubernetes cluster:

- **Keycloak**:
  - Set up Keycloak as the authentication provider.
  - Expose it via an HTTP/HTTPS service using an Ingress.
  - Reuse the [Bitnami Keycloak Project](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/keycloak).

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - Deploy a PostgreSQL database to be used by Keycloak.
  - Use environment variables to configure Keycloak to connect to the database.

- **PGAdmin**:
  - Deploy PGAdmin to allow management of the PostgreSQL database.
  - Expose it via an HTTP service using an Ingress.

- **Website**:
  - A simple website that will be provided by Tributech. This website will support authentication via Keycloak.
  - Clone the provided GitHub Repository and check the configuration to build the Docker Image locally.
  - The Helm chart should configure the website to authenticate using the Keycloak instance.

**Helm Chart Requirements**:
- Use the Umbrella approach for this Helm chart and provide a chart for each component (Keycloak, PostgreSQL, PGAdmin, and the website).
- Provide configurable options in `values.yaml` for:
  - Database credentials.
  - Hostnames for Keycloak, PGAdmin, and the website.
  - Check the configuration of the website and if there should be overrides for the `values.yaml`.
- The chart must be customizable using `helm install` overrides.

### 2. Set Up Local Development Environment

Set up a local Kubernetes cluster and prepare the environment for testing the Helm chart.

#### Prerequisites:
- Any Kubernetes distribution (e.g., Minikube, Kind, or K3s) version >= 1.29.0
- [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)
- Docker runtime.
- Helm CLI installed and configured.

#### Steps:
1. Set up a local Kubernetes cluster.
2. Install and configure Helm CLI.
3. Deploy the Helm chart to the local cluster.
4. Validate the deployment:
   - Ensure all components are running.
   - Verify that the configmaps, services, and secrets are valid.
   - Verify that Ingress (NGINX) is up and running.
   - Verify that:
     - Keycloak is accessible via Ingress (Admin Website should be visitable).
     - PostgreSQL is functional and connected to Keycloak.
     - PGAdmin is accessible and connects to PostgreSQL.
     - The provided website uses Keycloak for authentication and displays `Success` after login.

### 3. Documentation

Write a `README.md` file that includes:

1. **Concept and Design**:
   - Explain your architecture and approach to designing the Helm chart.
   - Describe how the components interact and are configured.

2. **Testing Instructions**:
   - Step-by-step instructions for:
     - Setting up the local Kubernetes environment.
     - Deploying the Helm chart.
     - Validating each component (Keycloak, PostgreSQL, PGAdmin, and the website).
   - Include example `helm install` commands with parameter overrides.

3. **Testing in Our Infrastructure**:
   - Provide instructions for deploying the Helm chart to our Kubernetes infrastructure.
   - Mention any prerequisites or assumptions (e.g., an existing Ingress controller or namespace setup).

---

## Deliverables

Once you complete the tasks, provide the following:

1. A fork of this repository with:
   - The Helm chart in a directory called `helm-chart/`.
   - A `values.yaml` file for the default configuration.
   - A corrected and working `README.md` file with detailed instructions.
2. Screenshots or evidence of the deployed application running in your local Kubernetes environment.
3. A link to your forked repository, shared with us.

## Example `values.yaml`

Below is an example configuration file to guide your implementation:

```yaml
keycloak:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hostname: keycloak.local

postgresql:
  username: keycloak
  password: keycloakpassword
  database: keycloakdb

pgadmin:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hostname: pgadmin.local
  admin:
    email: admin@example.com
    password: adminpassword

website:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
  hostname: website.local
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Fork This Repository**:
   - Fork this repository to your GitHub account to begin working on the assignment.

2. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - Install Docker, Kubernetes (e.g., Minikube or Kind), and Helm CLI.
   - Set up a local Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Deploy the Helm Chart**:
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the `helm-chart/` directory.
   - Deploy the chart using Helm:
     ```bash
     helm install my-app ./helm-chart -f values.yaml
     ```

4. **Validate the Deployment**:
   - Add entries to your local `/etc/hosts` file for the Ingress hostnames (e.g., `keycloak.local`, `pgadmin.local`, `website.local`).
   - Verify the following:
     - Keycloak is accessible via `http://keycloak.local`.
     - PGAdmin is accessible via `http://pgadmin.local`.
     - The website is accessible via `http://website.local` and authentication works with Keycloak.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Helm Chart Quality**:
   - Correct use of Helm templates and values.
   - Logical organization and reusability of templates.
   - Proper handling of configuration via `values.yaml`.

2. **Deployment**:
   - Successful deployment of all components using the Helm chart.
   - Integration between Keycloak, PostgreSQL, and the website.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Clarity, detail, and accuracy of the `README.md` file.
   - Correct explanation of the deployment process.

4. **Problem-Solving Skills**:
   - Your approach to configuring and deploying the components.
   - Handling challenges such as Ingress setup and inter-service communication.

---

## Bonus Points

- Add health checks for all services in the Helm chart.
- Include automated tests for validating the deployment.
- Use environment variables or Kubernetes secrets for sensitive information (e.g., database credentials).
- Provide additional customization options in the Helm chart.
